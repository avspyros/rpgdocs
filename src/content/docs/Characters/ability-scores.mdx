### Charisma

The measure of a character’s aptitude for leadership and the respect that others bestow on the character’s authority. It is not a measure of the appeal of a character’s personality (the player must
portray the character’s personality) nor a measure of the character’s beauty. **Charisma modifiers affect both the character’s ability to hire retainers and the loyalty of those retainers**.

### Constitution

The measure of a character’s health, vitality, and toughness. **Constitution modifiers affect a character’s Hit Points and fitness for certain physical activities such as traveling long distances**.

### Dexterity

The measure of a character’s agility and reflexes. **Dexterity modifiers affect a character’s Armor Class, ability to hit with ranged weapons, and ability to act first in combat**.

### Intelligence

The measure of a character’s knowledge prior to the start of play. Intelligence does not measure a character’s memory or ability to solve puzzles; it is the player’s wits that must be used in these
situations. **Intelligence modifiers affect the character’s ability to learn languages, are added to saving throw rolls against Magic-User spells, and for Magic-Users it affects the time (and thus
expense) required to research spells and create magic items, as well as influencing the saving throws of those subject to the Magic-User’s spells**.

### Strength

The measure of a character’s raw power. **Strength modifiers affect a character’s ability to hit in melee combat, open stuck doors, or succeed in unarmed combat**.

### Wisdom

The measure of a character’s connection to the greater universe, and the strength of the character’s spirit. Wisdom does not affect the character’s ability to make good decisions or judge situations
or characters; it is the player’s own judgment which must be used in these situations. **Wisdom modifiers affect the character’s non-spell related saving throw rolls, and for Clerics it affects the
time (and thus expense) required to research spells and create holy items, as well as influencing the saving throws of those subject to the Cleric’s spells**.
