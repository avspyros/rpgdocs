### Follow these steps to quickly create a character:

<Steps>

1. **Roll Ability Scores**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="1.1">
       <Bdg bt="Roll 3d6 for each ability:" />
       **Charisma, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Strength, Wisdom,** in order, and record them on your character
       sheet. A player can decide to swap the position of one ability score that was rolled with another.
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="1.2">
       <Bdg bt="Note modifiers" />
       Each ability score has a [Modifier](/reference/abilities) which is associated with it.
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="1.3">
       <Bdg bt="Is the Character suitable?" />
       If the total of all ability score modifiers is less than 0, discard and start again.
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Choose a Character Class**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="2.1">
       <Badge text="Cleric" size="small" variant="note" />
       <Badge text="Fighter" size="small" />
       <Badge text="Magic User" size="small" variant="tip" />
       <Badge text="Specialist" size="small" variant="caution" />
       <Badge text="Dwarf" size="small" />
       <Badge text="Elf" size="small" variant="success" />
       <Badge text="Halfling" size="small" variant="note" />
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="2.2">
       <Bdg bt="Determine HP" />
       1st level characters have a minimum number of HP according to their class. If the rolled amount is less than the indicated
       number on this [chart](/reference/hitpoints), simply use the number shown on the chart instead. Always add the Constitution
       modifier to the result.
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="2.3">
       <Bdg bt="Record modifiers & Saving Throws" />
       Record To-Hit Bonuses and Saving Throws on the Character sheet. Most classes get a +1 Attack Bonus. The Fighter gets
       an Attack Bonus of +2 at 1st level, and gains an additional +1 every time a level is gained.
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. **Select Alignment**

   Alignment is a character’s orientation on a cosmic scale. It has nothing to do with a character’s allegiances,
   personality, morality, or actions.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Lawful">Clerics must be Lawful.</TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Chaotic">Magic Users and Elves must be Chaotic.</TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Neutral">All others are free to choose their alignment, neutral or otherwise.</TabItem>
   </Tabs>

4. **Determine Starting Possessions**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="4.1">
       <Bdg bt="Roll money" />
       Every character begins with **3d6 × 10 sp** (silver pieces)
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="4.2">
       <Bdg bt="Buy equipment" />
       All characters are assumed to begin play with a decent set of traveling clothes appropriate for the weather conditions
       in the starting area of play. Apart from that, they can use the relevant equipment tables to buy their starting equipment.
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

5. **Choose a Name**

   Anything not (that) ridiculous...

</Steps>

### Character background / description

A summary of your character could be as short as: “I spent everything on gambling and I owe to some dangerous people” up
to a couple of pages long.

Optionally if you want to make your character seem more alive try to answer the following questions:

- “I turned to a life of adventuring (or vagabonding, or crime etc.) because … ?”
- “I will fight someone if … ?”
- "My vice (weakness) is … ?”
