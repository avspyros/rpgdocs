Specialists are professional explorers risking life and limb simply because a less active life is distasteful to them.
The Specialist is unique because the character class has no special abilities of its own. Instead, a Specialist is
better at certain activities that all characters are able to do at a basic level.

The Specialist begins at the same default level in these activities as other characters, but receives “points” which can
be allocated to improve his ability in the chosen skills. The available [skills](/../../guides/skills) (and their
default starting values for all characters) are:

- Architecture (1 in 6)
- Bushcraft (1 in 6)
- Climb (1 in 6)
- Languages (1 in 6)
- Search (1 in 6)
- Sleight of Hand (1 in 6)
- Sneak Attack
- Stealth (1 in 6)
- Tinker (1 in 6)
