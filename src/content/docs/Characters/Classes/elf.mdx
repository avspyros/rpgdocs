Elf PCs are either gifted individuals that are trained as both Fighters and Magic-Users and for some reason chose to walk among human societies, or are half-elven and a hard life has led them to use
their innate magical ability and train in combat to survive.

Elves use the same spell lists and spell progressions as Magic-Users. they do not need a spellbook to memorize spells. they don't get to choose a spell but they gain one at random when they gain a
level and they can only use it once per day. they begin at 1st level with **Read Magic**.

Elves’ enhanced senses allow them to Search more effectively than others (2 in 6 chance), and they are less often surprised than other races (1 in 6 chance).

### Details

Elves are creatures of magic related to the faerie. As such, they typically enjoy living in the deep wilderness and adapting their homes to be in harmony with their surroundings. they are on average
about five feet tall, and usually slender. Their most striking features are their pointed ears (how large these ears are will differ from region to region) and disproportionately large eyes which are
often a color not found in the other races.

Unlike the Dwarfs, the Elves recognize that the expansive nature of Man is simply the way of things, and accept their decline with grace. Their attitude towards Man is not so unified, however. Some
see Man as the natural heir to creation and seek to guide him and help him rule in wisdom. Some see Man as a great blight, and work to destroy him before he destroys all natural order. And some,
considered young and foolish by their people, walk among Man.
