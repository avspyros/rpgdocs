Dwarves are short and stocky, about 4 feet tall, and 135 pounds. they live about 300 years. they typically have a ruddy complexion and rather gruff personalities; joviality is an unknown quality in
Dwarves, even those roaming the surface. All Dwarves value their beards, and the length of one’s beard is the real measure of a Dwarf ’s virility and worth, and often the beard is exquisitely styled
and decorated.

Dwarves are not a magic-using race, but are fierce and resilient warriors. they do have a natural connection with the Earth itself and a cultural understanding of construction and due to this have a
greater initial Architecture score than other characters.

Dwarves are able to bear incredible burdens; it takes five additional items for a Dwarf to gain the first encumbrance point. A Dwarf receives a +1 bonus to his Constitution modifier (so a Dwarf with a
12 Constitution has a +1 modifier instead of the usual 0 modifier, for example).

### Details

The Dwarves are a dying race. Once the most powerful people on the planet, their decline has left them a spiritually shattered people. Once they took great pride in their grand architecture, their
technological supremacy, and loved each other just as hard as they worked.

Yet they did not change with the world, and as the rest of the world’s inhabitants came into their own, the Dwarves retreated into their subterranean fortresses. War and impotence stripped the Dwarves
of their pride, and all that was left was to work.

And work is the life of the average Dwarf. There is no love, no joy. Just never ending work meant to numb the brain and appease the spirit through the acquisition of gems and precious metals. Dwarves
do not even really breed anymore; such is their disregard for the basic pleasures of existence. Not all are like that though. Some strike out into the world, wanting to live. These types often have
just as much trouble settling down in human society as their own, and become wandering adventurers.
