Halfling PCs are those that have left their homelands to seek adventure and fortune. they are generally seen as troublemakers (and perhaps a touch crazy) by their kin who are not so inclined.

they are very quick and agile folk, and so add one to their Dexterity modifier and receive a one point bonus to Armor Class when not surprised. In the wilderness, Halflings have the uncanny ability to
stay hidden and so have a 5 in 6 Stealth skill. Halflings also begin with a 3 in 6 Bushcraft skill due to Halfling society being traditionally in harmony with nature. Due to their size, they cannot
use large weapons, and must use medium weapons two-handed.

### Details

Halflings are curious creatures who are popularly known as creatures of leisure, but there is far more to them than that. Usually standing about three feet tall, all other physical features of
Halflings will differ by region, but one never varies. they have rather large, hairy feet and prefer to go barefoot. Their feet are sufficiently protected and insulated that they suffer not frostbite
in the winter, nor disease or parasitical infestation in warmer climes.

Halflings as a race do tend to take their pleasures very seriously, and the fat and happy Halfling stereotype has taken hold because rural farmers, while dedicated and fastidious in their work, have
all the food that they could ever want and not a lot of reason to engage in moderation. Those used to that stereotype are very surprised the first time that they meet a chiseled, battle-scarred
warrior Halfling. Halflings live on average about one hundred years. One stereotype of Halflings that rings true is that while they tend to be gracious to guests and not shy about invitations, they do
prefer to be home.
