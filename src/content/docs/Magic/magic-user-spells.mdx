<Spell SpellTitle="Read Magic" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="0">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Allows the caster to decipher 1d4 magical inscriptions per casting. The caster can then read that specific writing
    again without using Read Magic. The spell can trigger cursed scrolls but does not activate other magic. Only the
    original owner can read their spellbook without this spell. If lost, Read Magic must be re-researched and rewritten
    in a new spellbook.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    By means of Read Magic, the caster can decipher magical inscriptions on objects—books, scrolls, weapons, and the
    like—that would otherwise be unintelligible. This does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing,
    although it can do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and the caster has read
    the magical inscription, he thereafter is able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of Read
    Magic. All spellbooks are written such that only the Elf or Magic-User who owns the book can decipher it without the
    use of this spell. Each casting of the spell allows the reading of 1d4 items. If a character loses access to Read
    Magic (a spellbook is stolen or destroyed, for instance), the character must research the spell as if it was unknown
    to him and then written up in a new spellbook.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Bookspeak" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="1 Round/level">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Allows the subject to ask an animated book one question per Round, receiving answers if the information is within
    the book. Only the spell's subject can question it; the book will growl at others. Intelligent books can save to
    resist, and magical books do not reveal effects. Provides no more information than reading would.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    When the subject of this spell touches a book, it animates, forming a mouth around the edge where the paper shows.
    The subject can ask the book one question per Round, and if the information is contained within the book, it will
    answer. If anyone else approaches or asks questions the book snaps and growls that Round instead of answering a
    question. Intelligent books can save to resist the spell (as a Magic-User of a level equal to the author). Magical
    books do not impart their effect when they answer. The spell is a shortcut to actually reading a book, and it will
    not give more information than a careful reading would.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Charm Person" SpellDuration="See Below" SpellRange="120'">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Causes one target to become deeply enamored with the caster if they fail a saving throw versus Magic. The charmed
    subject follows requests unless they contradict their interests, which prompts a new saving throw to resist. If the
    caster promises desirable rewards, no save is needed for compliance. Targets get additional saves if abused or
    threatened, with a +5 bonus if attacked. Works on humans and human-like creatures (except Elves) with up to 4 HD.
    After the spell ends, intelligent subjects retain memories of their actions.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    The Charm Person spell makes a single subject utterly enamored with the caster and desperate to please him if the
    saving throw versus Magic is failed. This is not mind control, as the subject retains his personality and controls
    how he acts but for his utter fascination with the caster. The caster must articulate his desires if he expects the
    subject to fulfill them. Any request which is not against the subject’s interests or personality will be followed.
    Any request which is against the subject’s interests or personality triggers a saving throw to refuse the request.
    If the saving throw is successful, the request will be refused, but this will not break the Charm. If as part of a
    request, the caster promises the subject something that the subject is normally inclined to want, then this saving
    throw is not necessary, and the subject will comply. This spell works on all humans and human-like creatures (except
    Elves); other (non player character class) humanoids are not affected if they have more than four Hit Dice. Abuse or
    neglect of the subject will trigger another saving throw to negate the Charm, and murderous violence towards the
    subject also triggers a save, but with a +5 bonus to the roll. The subject, if intelligent, will realize that he has
    been victim to mesmerism, and retain full memory of his actions while under the Charm after the spell ends.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Comprehend Languages" SpellDuration="1 Turn/level" SpellRange="0'">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Allows the caster to understand spoken words or read unknown written messages by touching the source and summoning
    spirits to translate, giving only the literal meaning. Does not enable speaking or writing in the unknown language.
    The reverse, Obscure Languages, nullifies Comprehend Languages or makes speech and writing incomprehensible by
    possessing the speaker's lips or reader's eyes.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    The caster can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages by
    summoning the spirits of the all-knowing dead to translate for him. The creature or the writing must be touched by
    the caster before the spirits can deliver any translation. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight
    into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables the caster to understand or read an unknown
    language, not speak or write it. Obscure Languages, the opposite of Comprehend Languages, dispels the effects of
    Comprehend Languages, or can be used to make spoken or written language incomprehensible by summoning spirits to
    possess the lips of a speaker, or the eyes of a reader, ruining all chances of communication.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Detect Magic" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="Line of Sight">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Reveals if anything within the caster's field of vision is magical, including magical creatures, items, or subjects
    of active spells. Does not identify the type of magic. Does not detect concealed, covered, or invisible objects, nor
    does it register spellcasters without active spell effects.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    This spell allows the caster to know if anything within his field of vision (or on his person) is in any way
    magical. This includes magical creatures, magical items, or any creature or object under the effect of an ongoing
    spell. Spellcasters such as Magic-Users and Elves do not detect as magic with this spell, but anyone that is under
    the effects of an active spell does. The spell does not identify the nature of the magic, only that magic is
    present. The caster must already be able to see the object in question in order to detect it as magical. Concealed,
    covered, or invisible objects will not be revealed by this spell.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Enlarge" SpellDuration="1 Turn/level" SpellRange="5'/level">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Increases the size of one creature or object within visible range:

    - Living Creatures: Enlarged by 20% per caster level, up to 300% of their original size.
    - Non-Living Objects: Enlarged by 10% per level, up to 200% of their original size.
    - Effect Area: Affects 10' cube of living matter or 5' cube of non-living matter per caster level.

    The target’s weight, strength, and mêlée damage increase proportionally to size. Magical item properties remain
    unchanged. The reverse spell, Reduce, shrinks targets by the same proportions. Targets may make a saving throw versus
    Magic to resist, which can be voluntarily failed if desired.

  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    The forces of magic do not recognize the relationships of size and distance between things; it is the limitations of
    the mind’s ability to master magic that results in strictures such as “spell range,” but sometimes the infinite
    nature of magic can be applied to material objects. This spell causes instant growth (and corresponding increase in
    weight and damage done) of a single object or creature that is in visible range. This increase changes a creature’s
    size by 20% per caster level, up to three times the original size of the creature. The effectiveness of this spell
    is half of this on non-living objects, which are only enlarged 10% per level and to a maximum of double the original
    size of the object. The caster can affect a 10' cube of living matter per level or a 5' cube per level of non-living
    matter. Magical item properties are not affected by this spell. For instance, a wand will have the same function
    even though it is increased to the size of a staff, and potion dosages are not increased, though they may take
    longer to drink. Objects do become stronger or heavier, so that a small rock gains the weight of an appropriately
    sized larger one, and a person enlarged will have a strength appropriate to his size (as an ogre or a giant, for
    example) with corresponding strength adjustments. The damage done by an Enlarged character during mêlée is increased
    by the same percentage as his size. The reverse of Enlarge, Reduce, can reduce objects or creatures in size by the
    same proportions as Enlarge. These spells cancel each other out. For either version of the spell a saving throw
    versus Magic is allowed to negate the effect. This save can be forfeited if the recipient desires.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Faerie Fire" SpellDuration="2 Rounds/level" SpellRange="80'">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Creates a pale glow around subjects, making them visible in darkness up to 80 feet away. It can affect creatures
    within a 40' radius and outlines up to one human-sized creature per caster level in blue, green, or violet light.
    The glow provides a +2 bonus to attackers but does no damage. Visibility range is halved near light sources.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects, making them hypervisible. Outlined subjects shed light that makes
    them visible in darkness at a distance of 80', or half this if the creatures are near a light source. The Magic-User
    can affect creatures within a 40' radius, and may outline up to one human-sized creature per caster level. The
    Faerie Fire can be blue, green, or violet, according to the Magic-User’s choice at the time of casting. The Faerie
    Fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined. However, their greater visibility grants
    attackers a +2 bonus to hit them while the spell is in effect.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Feather Fall" SpellDuration="See below" SpellRange="10/level">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Slows the descent of affected creatures or objects to 5 feet per Round, eliminating fall damage while the spell is active.

    - Effect Limit: Affects up to 200 lbs + 200 lbs per caster level (e.g., 400 lbs at level 1) within a 10' cube.
    - Instant Cast: Can be used reactively to prevent fall damage if Initiative is on the caster's side.
    - Restrictions: Only affects falling targets, not those grounded or flying. No saving throw is allowed.

    The spell ends as soon as the subject stops falling.

  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    The affected creatures or objects in range fall slowly. Feather Fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets
    fall to that of a feather (about 5' per Round), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in
    effect. The spell ends immediately when the subject stops falling. The spell can affect one or more objects or
    creatures, including gear and carried objects up to each creature’s maximum encumbrance. The maximum volume is a 10'
    cube, and 200 pounds + 200 pounds per level can also be affected, such that a 1st level Magic-User can affect 400
    pounds. The spell can be cast with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save the caster or another creature if he
    unexpectedly falls, but Initiative, if appropriate, must be on the side of the caster. The spell can be cast on
    falling items or creatures and missiles, but is ineffective against creatures firmly on the ground or flying. No
    saving throw is permitted.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Floating Disc" SpellDuration="6 turns" SpellRange="20'">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Creates a 3-foot-diameter concave disk of force that follows the caster, carrying up to 500 lbs or 2 gallons of liquid.

    - Height: Floats 3 feet above the ground, staying level.
    - Range and Movement: Follows the caster within spell range, maintaining a 6-foot distance.
    - Duration End: When the spell expires, the disk disappears, dropping its load.

    The disk keeps pace with the caster's movement and remains stable until the spell ends.

  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    The caster creates a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows him about and carries a heavy load for
    him. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 500 pounds. If used to transport a
    liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains
    level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany the caster with an equal movement rate. If
    not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 6' between itself and the caster, and will follow the
    caster without prompting to maintain a minimum of 6' distance. When the disk winks out at the end of the spell’s
    duration, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Hold Portal" SpellDuration="2d6 turns" SpellRange="10'">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Magically locks a door, gate, window, or shutter (wood, metal, or stone) as if it were physically locked.

    - Countered by: Knock spell or successful Dispel Magic spell.
    - Effect: Keeps the portal shut, preventing it from opening until the spell is negated.

  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the
    portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A Knock spell or a successful Dispel Magic spell can
    negate a Hold Portal spell.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Identify" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="Touch">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Reveals one magical property of an item per casting.

    - Requirements: 1 uninterrupted day in a 1,000 sp lab; costs 100 sp in materials per use.
    - Process: Each casting reveals one property; repeated castings needed to discover all properties.
    - Limitations: Does not reveal command words or detect curses.

  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    This spell allows the Magic-User to discern the magical properties of an item. The spell requires one uninterrupted
    day in a laboratory worth at least 1,000 sp to cast. At the end of the day, the Magic- User will have successfully
    determined one magical property of an item. The character will not know if there are additional properties unless he
    casts Identify again and another magical property of the item is determined. He will only know all of the magical
    properties of an item when he casts the spell and no new property is identified; both the “wasted” day and the
    “wasted” casting of Identify confirming that the item has no further properties. Note that a cursed item will not be
    identified as cursed, but as the item it pretends to be. This spell does not reveal command words. Each casting of the
    spell, successful or not, requires the expenditure of 100 sp worth of ingredients.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Light*" SpellDuration="3 Turns/caster level" SpellRange="120'">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    - Light Effect: Creates light equal to a torch, fixed in place or moving if cast on an object.
    - Targeting: Can be cast on an area or object. If resisted by an unwilling creature, the light defaults to the area.
    - Properties: Emits no heat and cannot be extinguished by water or wind, but can be blocked by covering.
    - Darkness (Reverse): Creates total darkness, blinding even creatures with dark vision. Can blind a creature if aimed at the eyes (saving throw applies).

  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    This spell creates a light source equivalent to that of a torch in the target area of the spell. The effect is immobile
    if cast on an area, but if cast on an object it moves with the object. Once cast, the caster has no control over the
    light, but can end the spell if he so wishes. If cast on a person or on the equipment of a person who does not wish to
    be the target of the spell, that person is allowed a saving throw versus Magic; success means that the spell is cast on
    the area the person is in, but not on a particular object. The light caused by the spell emits no heat, nor can it be
    extinguished by water or high winds. The source of the light can be covered, which will block the light, but this will
    not end the spell. Darkness, the reverse of the spell causes an area to be covered in total darkness; even creatures
    able to see in the dark are blind here. The spell can be targeted at a creature’s eyes specifically to blind it,
    assuming it has eyes in close proximity to one another. The target gets a saving throw versus Magic. If successful, the
    spell fails to work at all.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Magic Aura" SpellDuration="Permanent" SpellRange="Touch">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    - Magic Aura Effect: Imbues an object with a false magical aura, detectable by spells like Detect Magic. If the object is physically examined, the examiner may identify the aura as false with a successful saving throw versus Magic.

    - Obscure Aura (Reverse): Conceals the aura of a genuine magical item from Detect Magic and similar spells. If a caster both examines and holds the item, they may make a saving throw versus Magic to detect the concealed aura.

    - Limitations: Magic Aura only affects detection, not functionality or magical properties.

  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    This spell makes an object appealing to the microcosmic forces of magic, giving the item an aura that causes it to
    register to Detect spells (and spells with similar capabilities) as though it were magical. If the object bearing
    Magic Aura is physically examined (touched), the examiner recognizes that the aura is false if he succeeds in a
    saving throw versus Magic. Otherwise, he believes the aura, but no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is.
    The reverse of this spell, Obscure Aura, hides the magic aura of a legitimate magical item. A Magic- User casting
    Detect Magic and actually handling the item is permitted a saving throw versus Magic to see the magical aura of the
    item.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Magic Missile" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="60' + 10'/level">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    A forceful missile of magic energy automatically strikes a chosen target within range, dealing 1d4 damage per caster
    level. Targets struck by divided missiles (when the caster is at least 2nd level) may save for half damage. The
    missile always hits unless the target has total cover or concealment, and each caster’s missile has a unique visual
    signature.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    A missile of magical energy shoots forth from the caster’s fingertip and strikes its target, dealing damage equal to
    1d4 per level of the caster (so a second level Magic-User deals 2d4 points of damage). The missile strikes
    unerringly, even if the target is in mêlée combat or has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts
    of a creature cannot be singled out. The caster can throw the full force of the missile at a single target, but if
    the caster is 2nd level or higher, he can choose to divide the dice of damage between targets as he wishes. Dice
    must be assigned to targets before any damage is rolled, and targets of these divided dice are allowed a saving
    throw versus Magic, with success meaning that the target takes half damage. Each Magic-User’s Magic Missile is
    unique in appearance and always looks the same. When the caster writes a scroll, the resulting Missile looks
    identical to the normally cast version. When using a scroll written by another Magic-User, or memorizing a spell out
    of another’s spellbook, the resulting spell will look like that other caster’s Missile. Each different ‘signature’
    for a Magic Missile must be researched and/or transcribed as if it were a different spell.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Mending" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="30'">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Repairs small breaks or tears in non-magical objects, making them as strong as new. It works on a single break in
    metal items or multiple breaks in wood and ceramic, as well as holes in fabric or leather. This spell does not
    affect magical items or living creatures.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    Mending repairs small breaks or tears in objects. It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link,
    a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists. Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can
    be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by
    Mending. The spell cannot repair magic items, nor does it affect creatures.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Message" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="60' + 10'/level">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Allows the caster to send a whispered message to a creature in direct line of sight, which can reply in a whisper
    audible only to the caster. The spell transmits only sound, not meaning, so language barriers still apply. Subtle
    gestures allow the spell to be cast discreetly.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    This spell grants the caster the ability to whisper messages and receive whispered replies. The caster points his
    finger at a creature he wants to receive the message. The target must be in direct line of sight, with no barrier.
    The whispered message is audible only to the target. The creature that receives the message can whisper a reply that
    the caster can hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It does not transcend language barriers. Unlike castin
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Shield" SpellDuration="2 Turns" SpellRange="Touch">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Creates a magical barrier that shields the caster from attacks, granting AC 19 against missile attacks and AC 17
    against all other attacks. The spell also reduces damage taken from successful attacks by 1 point.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    Magic-Users are masters of matter and as such can command objects racing towards them to stop. The objects are
    sometimes impertinent, it is true, but this spell will protect the caster from many attacks which would otherwise
    harm him. Against missile attacks, the spell grants the caster AC 19, and an effective AC 17 for all other attacks.
    Even if an attack hits, it does one less point of damage than it otherwise would have.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Sleep" SpellDuration="d4 Turns" SpellRange="30' + 10'/level">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Causes creatures with 4+1 or fewer Hit Dice to fall into a magical slumber. The spell affects one creature with 4+1
    Hit Dice or a group of creatures totaling up to 2d8 Hit Dice, starting with those with the lowest Hit Dice.
    Creatures can only be awakened by slapping or wounding. Does not affect undead, constructs, or magical beings like
    Elves.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    A Sleep spell causes a magical slumber to come upon creatures with 4+1 or fewer Hit Dice. The caster can only affect
    1 creature if it has 4+1 or more Hit Dice, but the spell will otherwise affect creatures totaling no more than 2d8
    Hit Dice. Calculate monsters with less than 1 Hit Die as having 1 Hit Die, and monsters with a bonus to their Hit
    Dice as having the flat amount. For example, a 3+2 Hit Die monster would be calculated as having 3 Hit Dice. Excess
    Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Creatures with the fewest Hit Dice are affected
    first. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Sleep does not affect undead,
    constructs, or other magical or unnatural creatures (such as Elves).
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Spider Climb" SpellDuration="1 Turn/level" SpellRange="Touch">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Grants the target the ability to climb on walls and ceilings as a spider would, as long as their hands and feet are
    free. Objects under 5 pounds cling to the target's hands and feet. This spell can be cast on another being without
    requiring a saving throw.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as a spider does. The affected
    creature must have its hands and feet free to climb in this manner. Any objects weighing less than 5 pounds cling to
    the spell recipient’s hands and feet. This spell can be used on another being (touch required) with no saving throw.

<Spell SpellTitle="Unseen Servant" SpellDuration="1 Hour/level" SpellRange="30'">
  <p slot="spellsummary">
    Summons an invisible, mindless force to perform simple tasks at the caster’s direction, like fetching, cleaning, or
    holding items. The servant can lift up to 20 pounds or drag up to 40 pounds but cannot attack or be harmed as it is
    a magical force.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    An Unseen Servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at the caster’s command. It
    can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. It can open only normal
    doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It can lift 20 pounds or drag 40 pounds. The Servant cannot attack in any way,
    and it cannot be killed because it is a magical force, not a living thing.
  </p>
</Spell>
