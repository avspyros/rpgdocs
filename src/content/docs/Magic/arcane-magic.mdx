<Aside type="caution" title="Notes on spellcasters">
  All rules for Magic-Users also apply to Elves unless noted otherwise.
</Aside>

While spells are somewhat standardized effects used repeatedly by many Magic-Users, each spellcaster’s understanding and recording of a spell is highly individualized. Magic-Users must rely on
spellbooks because human minds cannot naturally contain magical knowledge. However, spell notation is not a set formula; it varies wildly from one user to another. For instance, the spell "Magic
Missile" might appear in the spellbooks of a hundred different Magic-Users, yet each version would be unique in style and content. Elves do not use a spellbook but instead have an innate spellcasting
ability.

### Access & Preparation

Each Magic-User starts with a spellbook containing the **Read Magic spell, 3 random 1st-level spells, and one chosen specialization spell**. At each new level, they gain a random additional spell,
which they must still research or transcribe. When they gain access to a new spell level, they can add a new specialization spell for that level. Magic-Users can prepare spells according to the
Magic-User table, plus one extra specialization spell per level. Elves, however, begin only with Read Magic and gain one spell each level.

To prepare spells, a Magic-User must rest for 6 hours, then study their spellbook for an additional time based on the highest-level spell they wish to prepare. This process, called memorization,
temporarily stores spells in their memory. Once cast, a spell fades and must be re-prepared. They can memorize the same spell multiple times up to their spell chart limits.

Elves have all their spells always prepared, matching the number they can cast. They only need to rest for 4 hours and can cast each spell once per day.

_(Will add examples here...)_

Prepared spells cannot be dismissed; they must be cast to free mental space. Reversed spells require separate research, transcription, and preparation. Magic-Users can only prepare spells once every
24 hours to avoid mental strain.

### Casting Spells

Casting spells requires Magic-Users to use both hands (or a staff/wand) and to freely recite the spell’s incantation. Any restrictions on movement or speech, like being bound or Silenced, prevent
casting. Spellcasting is always obvious and cannot be hidden. Magic-Users also cannot cast spells if encumbered beyond a Light load. Elves cannot cast spells if they are more than Heavily encumbered.

### Spell Scrolls

Scrolls allow a Magic-User to cast spells without memorization, even if the spell is beyond their usual ability. **The user must first cast Read Magic to understand the scroll, but once understood,
any spell on it can be cast.** Scrolls may contain multiple spells, but each spell can only be cast once, erasing it from the scroll. To cast from a scroll, the Magic-User must hold it with both
hands, and in combat, it requires a full action. The effects of the spell depend on the level of the Magic-User casting it, not the one who created the scroll.

### Writing a Scroll

Any Magic-User can create a spell scroll for any spell in his spellbook. The process costs 50 sp per day. Even though the scroll is essentially a “one-use” formula for a spell, each must still be
individually researched and crafted, and not mass-produced. Indeed, making a copy of a spell scroll will not imbue the copy with magical energy, or at the GM’s discretion, perhaps making the copy
would dissipate all magical energy from the original as well!

### Transcribing Spells

##### From a Scroll to a Spellbook:

If a Magic-User finds a spell scroll containing a spell not already in the Magic-User’s spellbook, he can instead transcribe the spell on the scroll into his spellbook. This will remove the spell from
the scroll. **The process costs 20 sp per day**.

##### From a Spellbook to a Spellbook:

While a Magic-User can freely use any spellbook upon which he has cast Read Magic, sometimes a Magic-User may want to consolidate spellbooks or create new ones. This process is similar to writing
scrolls, but does not erase the spell from the original source. **The process costs 10 sp per day**.

### Researching a Spell

A Magic-User can research spells of a higher level than he is able to cast and add them to his spellbook, but he may never prepare such spells. He can, however, write them on scrolls.

A player can invent totally new spells for his character to research. The player must first write the spell in the format of the other spells in the spell lists. The GM must approve the spell, and
should revise the spell for the player in advance of any research (sometimes this will merely involve altering the spell level). If successful, the character now has a spell that no other character
has in the game! For spells that are on the standard spell lists, the process costs 25 sp per day. **For wholly original spells, the process costs 30 sp per day**.

### Creating a Potion

Spells which affect a person can, be made into liquid form so that the imbiber gains the benefit of the spell. The maker of the potion must be able to cast the spell being turned into a potion. If a
Cleric assists the Magic-User, a potion capturing the essence of any of the healing spells (Cure Wounds or Cure Disease) can be made, though the Cleric must be of high enough level to cast the spell
in question. **The process to make a potion costs 50 sp per day**.

### Time of Magical Activities

When transcribing or researching spells, the character (and player) will never know exactly how long it will take. Magic is a risky business.

The player must declare ahead of time how long the character will take to perform the activity. The GM will randomly determine the actual necessary length of time it should take according to the table
below (which the player can also use to estimate how long they wish to work). The period must be uninterrupted for the character; any significant interruption undoes all work and the project must be
started anew. The costs up to that time are wasted. Only after the time passes in-game and the money is spent can success be determined.

If the character spent time equal to, or greater than, the amount necessary, then the work is automatically a success. If the character spent less time, the entire project is a failure; all work has
been for naught, all money spent has been wasted, and the process must begin again from scratch. There is a 5% chance that any failed project results in a curse as determined by the GM.

The time required for items 1–5 is doubled if the Magic-User is not working in a library worth at least 1,000 sp per level of the spell in question. Time to create a potion is doubled if the
Magic-User is not working in a laboratory worth at least 1,000 sp per level of the spell that the potion will duplicate. Creating a wand or staff requires both a library and a laboratory worth at
least 1,000 sp each per highest spell level included or the time is doubled.

The character’s Intelligence modifier is applied to the final number of required days (with a positive modifier lessening the number of days, of course). The minimum amount of time it takes to
research spells or write scrolls is never less than a day.

| Activity                                  | Time Required (Days)        | Cost (sp) |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------- |
| Writing a Scroll                          | Spell Lvl × 2d6             | 50/day    |
| Transcribing Spell (Scroll --> Spellbook) | Spell Lvl × 1d6             | 20/day    |
| Transcribing Spell (Scroll --> Spellbook) | Spell Lvl × 1d3             | 10/day    |
| Researching existing Spell                | Spell Lvl × 3d6             | 25/day    |
| Researching new Spell                     | Spell Lvl × 4d6             | 30/day    |
| Creating Potion                           | Spell Lvl × 1d6             | 50/day    |
| Creating Wand or Staff                    | Total Spell Lvls × 10 × 1d6 | 50/day    |

### Libraries and Laboratories

Magic-Users use libraries and laboratories to assist their magical activities. Each library or laboratory is ranked on its cost; for every 500 sp in value a library is worth, a ten foot square is
needed to store the books, and every 1,000 sp a laboratory is worth requires a ten foot square of space. Laboratory and library elements are non-transportable can only be purchased in large cities.

Every time the laboratory is used, the Magic-User must make a saving throw versus Magic. If the roll is successful, the laboratory loses 1d20 × 100 sp in value due to used supplies. If the roll is
failed, wasted supplies and accidents reduce the value of the laboratory by 2d20 × 100 sp. On a natural 1, there is a dangerous explosion which destroys both 5d20 × 100 sp of the laboratory’s value
and the project being worked on, and in addition, anyone present suffers 1d10 damage (save versus Breath Weapon for half).
