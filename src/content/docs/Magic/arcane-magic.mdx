<Aside type="caution" title="Notes on spellcasters">
  All rules for Magic-Users also apply to Elves unless noted otherwise.
</Aside>

While spells are somewhat standardized effects used repeatedly by many Magic-Users, each spellcaster’s understanding and
recording of a spell is highly individualized. Magic-Users must rely on spellbooks because human minds cannot naturally
contain magical knowledge. However, spell notation is not a set formula; it varies wildly from one user to another. For
instance, the spell "Magic Missile" might appear in the spellbooks of a hundred different Magic-Users, yet each version
would be unique in style and content. Elves do not use a spellbook but instead have an inate spellcasting ability.

### Access & Preparation

Each Magic-User starts with a spellbook containing the **Read Magic spell, 3 random 1st-level spells, and one chosen
specialization spell**. At each new level, they gain a random additional spell, which they must still research or
transcribe. When they gain access to a new spell level, they can add a new specialization spell for that level.
Magic-Users can prepare spells according to the Magic-User table, plus one extra specialization spell per level. Elves,
however, begin only with Read Magic and gain one spell each level.

To prepare spells, a Magic-User must rest for 6 hours, then study their spellbook for an additional time based on the
highest-level spell they wish to prepare. This process, called memorization, temporarily stores spells in their memory.
Once cast, a spell fades and must be re-prepared. They can memorize the same spell multiple times up to their spell
chart limits.

Elves have all their spells always prepared, matching the number they can cast. They only need to rest for 4 hours and
can cast each spell once per day.

_(Will add examples here...)_

Prepared spells cannot be dismissed; they must be cast to free mental space. Reversed spells require separate research,
transcription, and preparation. Magic-Users can only prepare spells once every 24 hours to avoid mental strain.

### Spell Scrolls

Scrolls allow a Magic-User to cast spells without memorization, even if the spell is beyond their usual ability. The
user must first cast Read Magic to understand the scroll, but once understood, any spell on it can be cast. Scrolls may
contain multiple spells, but each spell can only be cast once, erasing it from the scroll. To cast from a scroll, the
Magic-User must hold it with both hands, and in combat, it requires a full action. The effects of the spell depend on
the level of the Magic-User casting it, not the one who created the scroll.

### Writing a Scroll

Any Magic-User can create a spell scroll for any spell in his spellbook. The process costs 50 sp per day. Even though
the scroll is essentially a “one-use” formula for a spell, each must still be individually researched and crafted, and
not mass-produced. Indeed, making a copy of a spell scroll will not imbue the copy with magical energy, or at the GM’s
discretion, perhaps making the copy would dissipate all magical energy from the original as well!

### Researching a Spell

### Creating a Potion

Spells which affect a person can, be made into liquid form so that the imbiber gains the benefit of the spell. The maker
of the potion must be able to cast the spell being turned into a potion. If a Cleric assists the Magic- User, a potion
capturing the essence of any of the healing spells (Cure Wounds or Cure Disease) can be made, though the Cleric must be
of high enough level to cast the spell in question. The process to make a potion costs 50 sp per day.

### Time of Magical Activities

...

### Casting Spells

Casting spells requires Magic-Users to use both hands (or a staff/wand) and to freely recite the spell’s incantation.
Any restrictions on movement or speech, like being bound or Silenced, prevent casting. Spellcasting is always obvious
and cannot be hidden. Magic-Users also cannot cast spells if encumbered beyond a Light load. Elves cannot cast spells if
they are more than Heavily encumbered.
