Cleric magic is divinely inspired, and is granted to Clerics through prayer. Whether these powers are granted to Clerics
by higher powers, if these higher powers are what the Cleric believes them to be, or if all Cleric spells are merely
ritualized forms of sympathetic magic, are all subjects frequently debated. Only one thing is for sure: Cleric magic is
indeed magic of a sort. Even though Cleric spells are formalized in a way that Magic-User spells are not, their results
cannot be duplicated by non-Clerics.

### Access & Preparation

- All first level Clerics have full access to all first level spells.

- A Cleric must rest for 6 continuous hours before preparing spells and then must meditate and pray for a number of
  hours equal to the highest level spell being prepared.

- Spells remain in memory until they are cast, and once cast, the power of the spell leaves the caster. However, the
  same spell can be prepared multiple times.

- A Cleric can simply dismiss spells from his mind uncast, clearing the “spell slot” for other spells when preparing
  them as usual.

- Reversible spells must be prepared as either the “straight” version or the “reversed” version; the decision cannot be
  made at the time of casting.

- A Cleric can only safely prepare spells once every 24 hours. The mind simply cannot handle any more.

### Casting Spells

Spells are cast by a combination of mental concentration, gesticulation, and chanting. In order to cast a spell, a
Cleric must clutch a holy symbol of his religion and be able to chant freely. A character that is bound, gagged,
Silenced, or otherwise unable to gesture or speak, cannot cast spells. Casting a spell cannot be done secretly,
stealthily, or disguised as another activity; **the actions necessary to casting a spell will be obvious to all**.

### Spell Scrolls

Scrolls are magical items enabling Clerics to cast spells without prior memorization, including higher-level spells
beyond their normal casting ability. They are written in the language of the scroll's creator, allowing Clerics to use
them without needing the Read Magic spell, as long as they can understand that language. Scrolls written by Clerics from
different religions can be used interchangeably without penalty, which has led to speculation that Cleric magic may not
be strictly tied to any specific deity.

Using a scroll erases the spell from it, and a character must hold the scroll with both hands to read or use it. Casting
a spell from a scroll requires the full action of the caster, and the effects of the spell are determined by the level
of the Cleric using the scroll, not the level of the Cleric who originally wrote it.

### Writing a Scroll

Any Cleric can create a spell scroll for any spell that he is able to cast. The process costs 50 sp per day in offerings
to the Cleric’s deity and/or ritual expenses. Even though a scroll is essentially a “one-use” formula for a spell,
scrolls must be individually created with the requisite prayers and meditation.

##### Protection Scrolls

Clerics can create scrolls that repel specific types of creatures, with the Cleric choosing the exact category of
creatures to be affected. The description can be highly specific (e.g., "Humanoids who dwell in the Foul Caverns!") but
must allow for clear distinction between affected and unaffected creatures.

The creation of these scrolls requires a sacrifice of creatures from the chosen category, in line with the Cleric's
religious beliefs. The total Hit Dice of the sacrificed creatures determines both the crafting time and the success rate
of the scroll.

Specifically, for every 5 Hit Dice sacrificed, the Cleric spends one day crafting the scroll, and the total Hit Dice
equals the percentage chance of successful creation.

The process also incurs a cost of 50 silver pieces per day for offerings or ritual expenses related to the Cleric’s
deity.

Once activated, Protection Scrolls prevent the designated class of creature from approaching within 10 feet of the user
for a duration of d4 + 2 Turns.

### Creating Holy Water

To make holy water, it must first be placed in a basin located in a site considered holy by the Cleric's religion,
ensuring the water is at rest.

For nine consecutive days, the Cleric must cast a Bless spell on the water at the same time each day. On the tenth day,
the water is transferred to a vial, and a final Bless spell is cast on it.

Only after completing this ritual can the holy water be used effectively against unnatural beings and evil entities.
Most "holy water" used in general religious rituals is symbolic and does not possess the necessary potency against
undead or otherworldly creatures unless the specified ritual is performed.

### Researching a Spell

A Cleric’s player has the option to invent entirely new spells for their character to research. To do this, the player
must write the new spell using the same format as the existing spells in the spell lists. The spell must then be
submitted for approval by the Referee, who will assess the spell's suitability and balance before it can be used in the
game. The process costs 100 sp per day in sacrifices and/or ritual costs as determined by the Cleric’s religion.

### Time of Magical Activities

- When a character is writing scrolls or researching spells, the exact duration of the task is uncertain until it's
  completed.

- The player must declare how long they intend for the character to take, but the Referee will randomly determine the
  actual necessary time based on a provided table.

- The process must be uninterrupted; any significant interruptions will nullify all progress, requiring the project to
  be restarted from the beginning.

- If the character spends time equal to or greater than what is required, the work is automatically successful. However,
  if they spend less time, the entire project fails, resulting in wasted resources and a restart.

- There is a 10% chance that a failed project will result in a curse, as determined by the Referee.

- The required time is doubled if the Cleric is not working in a temple or church that meets a minimum size requirement
  based on the spell level.

- The character’s Wisdom modifier is applied to adjust the final number of required days (a positive modifier decreases
  the time).

- The minimum time to research spells or write scrolls is at least one day. Success is only confirmed after the declared
  time has elapsed and the required expenses have been incurred.
