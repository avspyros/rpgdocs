Cleric magic is divinely inspired, and is granted to Clerics through prayer. Whether these powers are granted to Clerics
by higher powers, if these higher powers are what the Cleric believes them to be, or if all Cleric spells are merely
ritualized forms of sympathetic magic, are all subjects frequently debated. Only one thing is for sure: Cleric magic is
indeed magic of a sort. Even though Cleric spells are formalized in a way that Magic-User spells are not, their results
cannot be duplicated by non-Clerics.

### Access & Preparation

All first level Clerics have full access to all first level spells.

A Cleric must rest for six continuous hours before preparing spells. After resting, the Cleric must meditate and pray
for a number of hours equal to the highest level spell being prepared.

Spells remain in memory until they are cast, and once they are cast, the power of the spell leaves the caster. However,
the same spell can be prepared multiple times.

A Cleric can simply dismiss spells from his mind uncast, clearing the “spell slot” for other spells when preparing them
as usual.

Reversible spells must be prepared as either the “straight” version or the “reversed” version; the decision cannot be
made at the time of casting.

A Cleric can only safely prepare spells once every 24 hours. The mind simply cannot handle any more.
