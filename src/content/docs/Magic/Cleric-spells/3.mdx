<Spell SpellTitle="Cure Disease*" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="Touch">
  <p slot="spellsummary">Cures all diseases or, in reverse, inflicts a deadly wasting illness.</p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">The subject of the spell must make a saving throw versus Magic in order for the spell to be effective.</p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    A successful casting instantly cures all diseases, including mummy rot and lycanthropy. If used against oozes or slimes, they do not receive a saving throw and suffer 1d6 damage per level of the
    caster (the cleric suffers an attack’s worth of damage when touching the slime with this attack).
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    Cause Disease (the reverse of Cure Disease) inflicts a terrible withering disease on a victim, which will cause death in 2d12 days. A saving throw versus Magic is allowed. This disease can be
    cured with the casting of Cure Disease. The victim of this disease cannot be cured of damage from other spells, and it takes twice the time for normal healing. This suffering further results in a
    penalty of –2 to hit rolls made by the victim.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Dispel Magic" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="120'">
  <p slot="spellsummary">Negates active spells and suppresses magic within an area.</p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    Empowers the proper forces of existence to expel the foul energies known as magic as if they never were. The spell affects a 20' cubic area. All spells in that area that are currently in effect
    are automatically negated. If cast on the same Segment in combat as a spell from an enemy combatant, Dispel Magic can be used to disrupt and negate that spell.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    Monsters with magical ability or able to create magical effects (including Elves, but not Magic- Users) lose the ability to use these powers for 2d6 Turns if they are within the area of effect and
    fail a saving throw versus Magic.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    All magical items within the area of effect are temporarily disenchanted. They regain their enchantment after 2d6 Turns. If the caster casts Dispel Magic as a touch effect, then any item so
    touched is permanently disenchanted.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">Dispel Magic negates magical curses or diseases for 2d6 Turns only.</p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Magic Vestment" SpellDuration="1 Turn/level" SpellRange="Touch">
  <p slot="spellsummary">Grants a scaling Armor Class bonus to an unarmored subject.</p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    Shields the subject through divine power, granting a +1 bonus to Armor Class per level of the caster. The spell does not function if the subject is wearing armor or benefiting from any protective
    enchantments or magical items.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Remove Curse*" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="Touch">
  <p slot="spellsummary">Removes a curse from a creature or, in reverse, inflicts one.</p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    Instantly removes one curse on a creature if it makes a saving throw versus Magic. It does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell enables the
    creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove it from his person and get rid of it. Remove Curse counters and dispels Bestow Curse.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    Bestow Curse (the reverse of Remove Curse) can bring about any number of unfortunate effects upon a being, determined by the caster and Referee. Some limits of effect must be enforced. Typical
    possibilities are limited to no more than a –2 penalty to saving throws or –4 to hit, an ability being reduced by 50%. These effects can have any number of creative symptoms. The victim can avoid
    being affected by Bestow Curse with a successful saving throw versus Magic.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Sacrifice*" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="Touch">
  <p slot="spellsummary">Transfers the cleric’s Hit Points to another or, in reverse, drains life.</p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">Allows the Cleric to transfer any desired number of Hit Points from himself to the target.</p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    The reverse of this spell, Drain Life, allows the caster to drain 1d6+1 Hit Points from a creature with a successful attack roll. The drained Hit Points are transferred to the cleric as healing.
  </p>
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Water Walk" SpellDuration="1 Turn/level" SpellRange="Touch">
  <p slot="spellsummary">Allows the subject to walk across liquids as if on solid ground.</p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">
    The subject is granted divine favor, allowing him to walk on water or any kind of liquid as if it were dry land. However, the liquid remains impenetrable, preventing the subject from reaching into
    it or passing through it.
  </p>
  <p slot="spelldescription">If the liquid is inherently dangerous, such as lava or acid, the subject still suffers its harmful effects. The subject may end the spell at any time.</p>
</Spell>
