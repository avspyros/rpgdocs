## Level 1

<Spell SpellTitle="Bless" SpellDuration="Instantaneous" SpellRange="Touch">
  Bestows the favor of the Cleric's deity upon the subject. That subject receives a number of points (1d6 + caster's
  level) to allocate to any future die rolls—To-Hit, saving throws, skill checks, surprise checks, whatever the subject
  desires—except damage rolls. The subject trades the points on a one-for-one basis and can adjust the roll by that many
  points however he sees fit. The number of points to be used on a roll must be declared before the roll is made. All
  unused points are lost at dawn the following day. No rolls relating to damage or anything concerning the use of magic
  use can be modified by Bless.
</Spell>

<Spell SpellTitle="Command" SpellDuration="1 Round" SpellRange="10'">
  When a Cleric casts this spell, he can give the subject a single word command, which it obeys to the best of its
  ability. The single word must make sense as a single command, such as approach, drop, fall, flee, halt, surrender,
  sleep, etc. Although a target could be instructed to die, this will only make the target collapse into a comatose
  state for a single Round. Note that the caster must be able to speak the language of the target. Any intended target
  that has more than 5 levels or Hit Dice, or an Intelligence of over 12 is entitled to a saving throw versus Magic.
  This spell is ineffective against undead.
</Spell>
