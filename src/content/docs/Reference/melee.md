\* _An “unadjusted” Armor Class is that of solely the armor and shield. Dexterity modifiers, magical modifiers, or any other adjustments are not countedwhen determining unadjusted AC._

\*\* Some weapons can attack “from the second rank.” This is used when there is a definite battle line in combat. Usually only those on the front line of battle can strike, but those weapons usable
from the second rank allow anyone immediately behind the battle line to strike as well.
