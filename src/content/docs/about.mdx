This guide is based on the Lamentations of the Flame Princess rules with some homebrew modifications.

The goal of the game is primarily exploration and survival, with combat being secondary to the experience.

Supernatural beings and effects (magic) are rare and dangerous.

Characters don’t need elaborate backstories, as they might not even survive the session.

Players are expected to make decisions in morally ambiguous situations where concepts of “good” and “evil” may not
apply.

The heroes' main goal is to amass wealth, gain power, or simply survive harsh circumstances. They are guided by
curiosity and wanderlust.

#### Disclaimers:

The **GM** has always the final say and is there to set the scene, describe the world and control NPCs and creatures.
**If any hero dies it is because of the player's decisions or just bad luck**.
