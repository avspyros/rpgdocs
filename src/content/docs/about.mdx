This guide is based on the **Lamentations of the Flame Princess** ruleset but with some homebrew modifications.

The game emphasizes **exploration** and **survival** above all else, with combat serving as a dangerous but secondary aspect of play.

Supernatural forces and magic are rare, unpredictable, and perilous to encounter.

Characters require no elaborate backstories (simple ones can be as interesting), since they might not even survive the 1st session of play.

Players are expected to make decisions in morally ambiguous situations where concepts of “good” and “evil” may not apply.

The Characters' main goals are to amass wealth, gain power, or simply survive harsh circumstances. they are guided by curiosity, wanderlust or their personal desires...

#### Disclaimers:

The **GM** is there to describe the world, set the scene and control all NPCs or creatures. The **GM** always has the final say in terms of rules/rulings. **If any Character dies it is because of the
player's decisions or just bad luck**.
