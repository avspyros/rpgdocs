This guide is based on the **Lamentations of the Flame Princess** rules with some homebrew modifications.

The goal of the game is mostly Exploration and Survival with combat being secondary to the experience.

Supernatural beings and effects (magic) are rare and dangerous.

Characters don't need to have any elaborate back stories since the might not even survive the session.

Also, the player is expected to make desicions in situations of moral ambiguity where "good" and "evil" do not
necessarily apply.

The heroes main goal is to amass wealth, power or just survive hard circumstances. They are guided by curiocity and
wanderlust.

#### Disclaimers:

The **GM** has always the final say and is there to set the scene, describe the world and control NPCs and creatures. If
any hero dies it is because of the player's decisions or just bad luck.
