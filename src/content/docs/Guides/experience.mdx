## Experience points

At the end of every session of play, Experience Points will be awarded to characters who participated in the game. These Experience awards are to be divided equally amongst the surviving participants
of the adventure. Characters present for portions of the adventure should only get a share of Experience for the activities in which they participated. Experience Points are gained in three
waysâ€”Defeating Enemies, Recovering Treasure and completing Adventures or chapters of Adventures.

### Defeating Enemies

- An enemy for XP purposes must be a threat and predisposed to hostility towards the player characters.
- Defeating an enemy for XP involves winning a battle by using or threatening force, with the enemy reduced to 0 HP, failing a Morale check, or surrendering.
- Sneaking, tricking, or negotiating with an enemy does not grant XP, though other rewards may be possible.
- Neutralizing or pacifying an enemy with spells like Sleep or Charm counts as "defeating" for XP.
- An enemy can only provide XP once per game session.
- Monsters with special abilities count as one additional Hit Die, and classed characters count as one additional Hit Die above their level.

### Recovering Treasure

The following treasures count for XP purposes:

- All valuable objects recovered from uncivilized or abandoned areas.
- Money or items hoarded by creatures who have no actual use of it.
- Money or items taken as loot from defeated antagonists/enemies.

Treasure is calculated for XP only after it has been returned to a secure location. One silver piece worth of treasure is worth 1 Experience Point. Experience is divided between all surviving party
members involved in an adventure.

### Completing Adventures

When the PCs have finished a chapter of their campaign or an adventure (or scenario), the GM may grant them some XP as bonus for completion.

### Action Points

An Action point can be used by the player to roll 2 dice and keep the highest (or lowest) number. Applies to: attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks. PCs can have up to 3 Action points available at
each given time. 1 Point is awarded while gaining a level or as a bonus for achieving something significant or completing a milestone in the campaign.
