### Surprise

- **Roll 1d6** for each side which might be surprised - most actors **surprised on 1-2**.
- Surprised actors unable to act **for 1 Round**.
- Actors well hidden or prepared for ambush **surprise on 1-4**.
- For each point a **Specialist** puts in **Sneak attack** the damage multiplier is increased by 1.

### Encounter Distance

- Encounters begin with the closest opposing characters 3d6 × 10' apart, unless there are specific details which would define the encounter distance, such as being in fog or a forest.
- In environments with limited visibility, the maximum encounter distance will be the visibility distance.

### Reactions

- NPCs’ reactions will be obvious based on the circumstance of the encounter.
- If there is any doubt, consult this [chart](../../reference/reactions).
- The chart can also be used when someone is attempting to convince an NPC as to a course of action and there is doubt as to the outcome.

### Initiative

1. **Roll 1d6** for each side or actor or group of actors on each side.
2. Surprised actors do not roll this round.
3. GM counts from 6 to 1 - **Participants act on their number**.
4. In case of **tie use Dexterity modifier** or combatants act simultaneously.

### Morale

- NPCs and creatures do not always fight to the death.
- Each NPC, monster, or group of the same creatures should include a Morale score, a figure between 2 and 12.
- To make a Morale check, roll 2d6; if the roll is equal to or less than the their Morale score, they are willing to stand and fight.
