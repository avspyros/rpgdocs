### Surprise

- **Roll 1d6** for each side which might be surprised - most actors **suprised on 1-2**.
- Suprised actors unable to act **for 1 Round**.
- Actors well hidden or prepared for ambush **surprise on 1-4**.
- For each point a **Specialist** puts in **Sneak attack** the damage multiplier is increased by 1.

### Encounter Distance

- Encounters begin with the closest opposing characters 3d6 × 10' apart, unless there are specific details which would
  define the encounter distance, such as being in fog or a forest.
- In environments with limited visibility, the maximum encounter distance will be the visibility distance.

### Reactions

- NPCs’ reactions will be obvious based on the circumstance of the encounter. If there is any doubt, consult the
  following chart.
- This chart can also be used in any situation where someone is attempting to convince an NPC as to a course of action
  and there is doubt as to the outcome.

| Roll | Reaction    |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 2    | Hostile     |
| 3–5  | Unfriendly  |
| 6–8  | Indifferent |
| 9–11 | Talkative   |
| 12   | Helpful     |
