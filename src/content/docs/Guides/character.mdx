### Follow these steps to quickly create a character:

<Steps>

1. **Roll Ability Scores**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Roll 3d6 for each ability">
       **Charisma, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Strength, Wisdom,** in order, and record them on your
       character sheet. A player can decide to swap the position of one ability score that was rolled with another.
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Note modifiers">
       Each ability score has a [Modifier](../reference/abilities) which is associated with it.
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Is the Character suitable?">
       If the total of all ability score modifiers is less than 0, discard and start again.
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Choose a Character Class**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Classes">
       <Badge text="Cleric" size="small" variant="note" />
       <Badge text="Fighter" size="small" />
       <Badge text="Magic User" size="small" variant="tip" />
       <Badge text="Specialist" size="small" variant="caution" />
       <Badge text="Dwarf" size="small" />
       <Badge text="Elf" size="small" variant="success" />
       <Badge text="Halfling" size="small" variant="note" />
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Determine Hit Points">
       1st level characters have a minimum number of HP according to their class. If the rolled amount is less than the
       indicated number on this [chart], simply use the number shown on the chart instead. Always add the Constitution
       modifier to the result.
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Record modifiers & Saving Throws">
       Record To-Hit Bonuses and Saving Throws on the Character sheet.
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. **Select Alignment**

4. **Determine Starting Possessions**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Roll money">Every character begins with 3d6 × 10 sp (silver pieces)</TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Buy equipment">
       All characters are assumed to begin play with a decent set of traveling clothes appropriate for the weather
       conditions in the starting area of play. Apart from that, they can use the cheapest column prices from the
       equipment table to buy their starting equipment.
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

5. **Choose a Name**

   Anything not (that) ridiculous...
