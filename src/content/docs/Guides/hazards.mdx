### Ability Score Loss

- Loss of ability scores means modifiers and bonuses will change.
- Constitution loss affects current and maximum HP.
- 0 in an ability score means death.

{/* ### Aging */}

### Damage

- The amount of damage is deducted from an actor’s current HP.
- When HP reach 0, an actor is unable to take any action.
- PCs become mortally wounded at –3 HP and will die in 1d10 minutes.
- Only magical healing that causes HP to become 0 may save them.
- Death is instantaneous at –4 HP.

### Disease

- When exposed to a disease, the GM will make a **save vs Poison** on behalf of the character.
- If the save is failed, then the character has contracted the disease.
- The incubation period describes the length of time before the character is affected, and at that point the character ** must make another save,**
- Then **another save** at every interval point for the duration of the infection time, or else suffer the effect for each failed save.
- Each save after the disease is contracted is made with a –2 penalty if the character is not at rest for the duration of the infection.

<Aside type="caution" title="Example">
  > The Green River Fever has an incubation period of 1 week, an interval of 4 hours, an infection time of 3 days, and the effect of lowering Intelligence. So beginning one week after a character has
  been infected, that character must make a saving throw vs Poison every 4 hours for 3 days (a total of 18 saving throws), or lose a point of Intelligence for each failed save
</Aside>

### Drugs & Alcohol

- Save vs Poison or suffer the effects.
- Drunk characters get –2 to Dexterity and all saving throws.

### Falling

- Characters suffer **1d6 points of damage per 10'** that they fall, up to a maximum of 20d6 for a 200' fall.

### Poison

- When exposed to poison, a character must make a saving throw against Poison or suffer the effects.
- Typical effects are instant death, falling into a deep slumber, the loss of HP, or the reduction in one or more ability scores.

### Starvation

- A character must eat at least 1 full meal a day & drink water every day or suffer ill effects.
- For every 24 hours a character goes without food, they must make a save versus Poison or one Constitution point is lost.
- For every 24 hours a character goes without water, his Constitution drops by half unless they make a save vs Poison.

### Sleep Deprivation

- A character suffers a –1 penalty to all rolls (10% penalty for 1d00% rolls) if they sleep for less than 4 hours every 24 hours.
- If this continues there is a cumulative –1/10% penalty for each additional day that passes without proper rest being taken.
