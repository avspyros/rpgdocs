### Healing

- Damaged characters who have at least half of HP remaining recover 1 HP after a peaceful night’s rest.
- Taking a watch shift does not prevent this recovery unless something happens during the shift.
- Damaged characters who have at least half of HP remaining can also recover an additional 1d3 hp by resting a full day
  (the character can do no more than converse and walk around his immediate area.).

### Light & Vision

- Torches and lanterns emit light in a 30' radius. Candles emit light in a 10' radius.
- Lanterns use flasks of oil as fuel and can burn continuously on 1 flask of oil for 4 hrs.
- Torches burn continuously for 1 hr before burning out.
- Candles will burn for 1 hrs.
- Characters that carry a light source are unable to surprise opponents.
- The GM’s judgment will determine how far characters can see in other situations.

### Mapping

- Mapping a structure or underground complex requires 1 character to have paper, ink and 2 free hands.
- The GM is only obligated to give verbal descriptions of the area, and if asked by a player how his map compares to the
  real map, the GM is only obligated to point out very obvious errors.
- If the PCs are moving at “exploration” speed, then the GM should give exact dimensions of hallways and areas—taking
  such measurements is one reason why the party’s progress is so slow.
- Extremely irregular areas, such as natural caves, can best be left to rough descriptions, since accurate mapping
  without a full survey team is simply impossible.
- Outdoor mapping is not as exacting a process. If using the hex map system of overland travel, the GM simply informs
  the players what sort of terrain their that characters are moving into and the surrounding terrains as well.

### Time

There are three units of time that have special meaning in the game:

- The “Turn” is ten minutes long. This is often used as a measure of time for spell durations and underground exploring.
- The “Round” is six seconds long. This is primarily used for time management during combat and for the duration of
  combat-oriented spells.
- The “Segment” is one second long. During each round of combat, characters will act in different orders. The exact
  moment when a character’s action occurs is called the “Segment.”
