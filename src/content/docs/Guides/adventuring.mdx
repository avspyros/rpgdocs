### Doors

Locked doors are impassable without a key, picking the lock (which requires a Tinker skill roll and Specialist Tools),
or breaking the door down. Breaking the door down requires the appropriate equipment (some sort of axe for a wooden
door, a pick for stone, etc.) and takes 1 turn for wooden doors, 2 or more turns for doors made of other materials.

Many doors in dungeons and ruins are merely stuck.

- To open a standard stuck door (wood with iron banding), a character must successfully make an Open Doors roll (base 1
  in a 6 chance),
- Strength modifiers apply to the roll’s chances, so having a Strength modifier of +1 means there is a 2 in 6 chance of
  opening the door. -
- Use of a crowbar adds a further 1 to the chance, and each additional person helping adds another (although only two
  people can attempt to open a standard-sized door).
- Each attempt takes 1 turn.
- Doors made of stronger or heavier materials may need a greater number to open (a giant stone door may have a –2 in 6
  chance to be opened, requiring bonuses before there is even a chance to open it, for example), or be impossible to
  open.

### Foraging and Hunting

Characters may be able to find food and water during their journeys overland. To find food in the wilderness, the
character must roll against his Bushcraft skill, with terrain modifying the skill as follows:

| Terrain  | Chance of finding food |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| Plains   | +1 in 6                |
| Mountain | normal                 |
| Forest   | +2 in 6                |
| Desert   | –1 in 6                |
| Jungle   | +2 in 6                |
| Swamp    | normal                 |

- Hunting takes time, and the distance traveled during a day where successful hunting occurs is lessened by 1d4 × 25%.
- Unsuccessful hunting takes all day. Success means that 1d4 days’ worth of meals for a single person has been acquired
  for the party.
- 1d10 units of ammunition are expended in the attempt. If a character does not have a proper missile weapon, the chance
  to find food is lowered by 1. If a character has no missile weapon at all, reduce the chance by one more.
- If it is winter, reduce the chances by another point unless in the desert, where this does not matter.
- All food gained from foraging and hunting is considered to be the equivalent of “standard rations.”
- The chances of Finding enough water to drink is easy in most environments, but in the desert water can only be found
  if a Bushcraft roll is successfully made on 1d12 rather than 1d6.

### Getting Lost

Characters can confidently follow trails, roads, and other well-known landmarks without fear of becoming lost. However,
when traveling across the wilderness it is easy to lose direction.

1. At the start of each day of travel, the GM will roll 1d6, and on a 1 the party may go off course.
2. The GM should then make a secret roll against the highest Bushcraft skill among the characters in the traveling
   party.
3. If this roll fails, the group is lost.
4. If the roll indicates that the party is lost, it likely will not realize it immediately. The party will continue on
   in its travels, its members not understanding that they are off course for days.

The GM will decide which direction the group is traveling, and how far off it is from its intended direction. One option
is to pick a direction only slightly off course. For example, if the group intended to go south, it is actually headed
southwest or southeast.

### Healing

- Damaged characters who have at least half of HP remaining recover 1 HP after a peaceful night’s rest.
- Taking a watch shift does not prevent this recovery unless something happens during the shift.
- Damaged characters who have at least half of HP remaining can also recover an additional 1d3 hp by resting a full day
  (the character can do no more than converse and walk around his immediate area.).

### Light & Vision

- Torches and lanterns emit light in a 30' radius. Candles emit light in a 10' radius.
- Lanterns use flasks of oil as fuel and can burn continuously on 1 flask of oil for 4 hrs.
- Torches burn continuously for 1 hr before burning out.
- Candles will burn for 1 hrs.
- Characters that carry a light source are unable to surprise opponents.
- The GM’s judgment will determine how far characters can see in other situations.

### Mapping

- Mapping a structure or underground complex requires 1 character to have paper, ink and 2 free hands.
- The GM is only obligated to give verbal descriptions of the area, and if asked by a player how his map compares to the
  real map, the GM is only obligated to point out very obvious errors.
- If the PCs are moving at “exploration” speed, then the GM should give exact dimensions of hallways and areas—taking
  such measurements is one reason why the party’s progress is so slow.
- Extremely irregular areas, such as natural caves, can best be left to rough descriptions, since accurate mapping
  without a full survey team is simply impossible.
- Outdoor mapping is not as exacting a process. If using the hex map system of overland travel, the GM simply informs
  the players what sort of terrain their that characters are moving into and the surrounding terrains as well.

{/* ### Movement & Encumbrance */}

### Swimming

- It is assumed that every character knows how to swim.
- Characters move at half their normal movement when swimming.
- Heavily encumbered characters, wearing plate mail armor and/or carrying a large proportion of treasure have 4 in 6
  chance of drowning.
- Lightly encumbered characters, have 1 in 6 chance of drowning.

### Time

There are three units of time that have special meaning in the game:

- The “Turn” is ten minutes long. This is often used as a measure of time for spell durations and underground exploring.
- The “Round” is six seconds long. This is primarily used for time management during combat and for the duration of
  combat-oriented spells.
- The “Segment” is one second long. During each round of combat, characters will act in different orders. The exact
  moment when a character’s action occurs is called the “Segment.”

### Traps

Dungeons and ruins frequently contain traps, including spear-throwers, covered pits, etc.

The GM will decide what is required to trigger a trap, and what happens when the trap is triggered. In general, there
must be some way to avoid or reduce the effect of the trap being sprung. For instance, a save versus Paralyzation is
often used to avoid falling into a covered pit, while spearthrowers, automated crossbows, and the like are sometimes
treated as if they were monsters (attacking the victim’s Armor Class at a given Attack Bonus).

Any character can use the Search skill (base 1 in 6) to determine if an area or object has any secret mechanism or
function, including traps. A successful use of this skill does not tell what the function is (it may very well be
something that the character should want to trigger!), but will let the character know that it is there and how it is
triggered.

The search takes one turn per 10' square searched. Trap detection may not be allowed if the trap is purely magical in
nature; on the other hand, in such cases Magic-Users, Elves, and/or Clerics may be able to detect magical traps at the
given 1 in 6 chance, at the GM’s discretion.
