<Aside title="Actor:" type="caution">
  Character, PC, NPC or creature.
</Aside>

### Aiming

- If using a missile weapon, a character can decide to take a full Round to aim.
- This means taking absolutely no action for an entire Round except aiming, during which time the aiming character applies no Dexterity modifiers to his AC.
- On the following round the aiming character receives a +4 to hit when firing on his action.
- The aiming time is in addition to normal reload times.

### Attacking from Behind

If a character is attacked from behind by an enemy he is not aware of:

- The character loses all Dexterity and shield modifiers to AC.
- The enemy receives a further +2 bonus to hit.

### Cover

[Cover](../../../reference/armor_cover/) is protection behind something that can actually block incoming attacks, such as a wall or arrow slit.

### Firing into Mêlée

- Firing into mêlée with a missile weapon is a very uncertain thing.
- If doing so, randomly determine who in the mêlée is actually targeted before rolling to hit.
- If the firing character takes a full Round to aim, one possible target of the firing character’s choice counts as two people in the mêlée when the Referee comes to determine the targets.

<Aside type="caution" title="Example">
  > If a character fires into a combat where two of his allies are fighting a lone enemy, normally there would be an equal chance of targeting each of the 3 combatants. **After aiming**, the enemy
  would count as 2 figures, giving a full 50% chance that the enemy would be the one targeted.
</Aside>

- Significantly larger actors in mêlée count as 2 characters for random targeting purposes, and truly gargantuan creatures can be fired upon using the normal rules.
- Dexterity modifiers do not apply, for either the firing character or the targets, when resolving missile fire into mêlée.

### Helpless opponents

Helpless opponents, defined as those sleeping, bound, magically frozen, etc., are automatically hit for maximum damage by anyone attacking them with a mêlée weapon.

#### Holy Water

- Can be sprinkled on an opponent within mêlée range - the opponent will always be considered **AC 12** unless using actual armor and/or shield.
- This takes up both the attacker’s hands and actions for the full Round.
- If in a glass container or flask, can be thrown with the same range modifiers as a rock.
- If it hits, it will only break and unleash the holy water 75% of the time. Otherwise it simply does the same damage as a thrown rock.
- Inflicts 1d8 damage against appropriate targets such as undead, summoned creatures, innately magical beings such as Elves, etc.

### Invisibility & Darkness

- Actors fighting opponents they cannot see suffer a **–6 penalty to hit in mêlée** and all attacks against them by the unseen party are considered to be “from behind” (if the unseen party is able to
  see).
- Missile attacks against unseen targets **automatically miss**.
- GM may decide to check to see if a random character is hit in the dark if a character fires wildly into occupied dark space.

#### Oil and fire

- Flask of oil must be in hand, its lid or stopper removed, and a wick of some sort (usually a bit of cloth) already prepared and lit.
- Uses the same rules as thrown rock for purposes of hitting the target.
- If a creature is subjected to ignited lamp oil, it will suffer 1d4 points of damage.
- If the damage roll is 4, then the victim must make a saving throw versus Breath Weapon or else suffer another 1d4 damage on his next action.
- If that roll is a 4 as well, then the victim becomes engulfed in flames suffering 1d8 damage per Round until it either dies, or the fire is put out.

### Pursuit

Unless the chase occurs over open terrain:

1. Both the pursuer and the pursued roll 1d20.
2. Each adds their movement rate divided by 10 to the roll. Example: A character with a movement rate of 120' adds +12 to their roll.
3. The higher total determines the winner of the pursuit.

### Mounted Combat

Mounted characters receive:

- **+1 to hit** (unless using minor or small weapons) and a **+1 AC bonus** when in mêlée combat against enemies on foot.
- **–4 penalty** to hit with missile fire while mounted.

### Unarmed combat

Fists are treated as minor weapons, doing 1d2 HP damage.

### Wrestling

Wrestle to immobilize or disarm another character.

- The attacker must have both hands free.

- If the defender is armed and hasn't acted this round, they get a free attack against the aggressor before the wrestling attempt.

- Both parties roll 1d20 + their melee Attack Bonus + Strength modifier. Ties are decided by Dexterity modifier or a further die roll.

Outcomes (winner chooses):

- Immobilize: Loser is held and can only attempt to escape or make minimal attacks with natural or small weapons. After 3 failed escapes, the loser is pinned and helpless.

- Disarm: The loser must make a save vs. Paralyzation to keep the contested object.
- Release: End the wrestling.

Special Rules:

- Wrestling Attacks: While grappling, all involved are treated as surprised for attacks.
- Multiple Attackers: Use the best roll among attackers, with +1 bonus per additional attacker.
- Special Abilities: Creatures with abilities like tentacles or adhesive gain +1 per Hit Die.
