### Aiming

- If using a missile weapon, a character can decide to take a full Round to aim.
- This means taking absolutely no action for an entire Round except aiming, during which time the aiming character has
  no Dexterity modifiers to his AC.
- On the following round the aiming character receives a +4 to hit when firing on his action.
- The aiming time is in addition to normal reload times.

### Attacking from Behind

If a character is attacked from behind by an enemy he is not aware of:

- The character loses all Dexterity and shield modifiers to AC.
- The enemy receives a further +2 bonus to hit.

### Cover

[Cover](../../../reference/armor_cover/) is protection behind something that can actually block incoming attacks, such
as a wall or arrow slit.

### Firing into Mêlée

- Firing into mêlée with a missile weapon is a very uncertain thing.
- If doing so, randomly determine who in the mêlée is actually targeted before rolling to hit.
- If the firing character takes a full Round to aim, one possible target of the firing character’s choice counts as two
  people in the mêlée when the Referee comes to determine the targets.

<Aside type="caution" title="Example">
  > If acharacter fires into a combat where two of his allies are fighting a lone enemy, normally there would be an
  equal chance of targeting each of the 3 combatants. **After aiming**, the enemy would count as 2 figures, giving a
  full 50% chance that the enemy would be the one targeted.
</Aside>

- Significantly larger actors in mêlée count as 2 characters for random targeting purposes, and truly gargantuan
  creatures can be fired upon using the normal rules.
- Dexterity modifiers do not apply, for either thefiring character or the targets, when resolving mis-sile fire into
  mêlée.

### Helpless opponents

Helpless opponents, defined as those sleeping, bound, magically frozen, etc., are automatically hit for maximum damage
by anyone attacking them with a mêlée weapon.

#### Holy Water

- Can be sprinkled on an opponent within mêlée range - the opponent will always be considered **AC 12** unless using
  actual armor and/or shield.
- This takes up both the attacker’s hands and actions for the full Round.
- If in a glass container or flask, can be thrown with the same range modifiers as a rock.
- If it hits, it will only break and unleash the holy water 75% of the time. Otherwise it simply does the same damage as
  a thrown rock.
- Inflicts 1d8 damage against appropriate targets such as undead, summoned creatures,innately magical beings such as
  Elves, etc.

#### Oil and fire

- Flask of oil must be in hand, its lid or stopper removed, and a wick of some sort (usually a bit of cloth) already
  prepared and lit.
- Uses the same rules as thrown rock for puproses of hitting the target.
- If a creature is subjected to ignited lamp oil, it will suffer 1d4 points of damage.
- If the damage roll is 4, then the victimmust make a saving throw versus Breath Weapon or else suffer another 1d4
  damage on his next action.
- If that roll is a 4 as well, then the victim becomes engulfed in flames suffering 1d8 damage per Round until it either
  dies, or the fire is put out.

### Invisibility & Darkness

- Actors fighting opponents they cannot see suffer a **–6 penalty to hit in mêlée** and all attacks against them by the
  unseen party are considered to be “from behind” (if the unseen party is able to see).
- Missile attacks against unseen targets **automatically miss**.
- GM may decide to check to see if a random character is hit in the dark if a character fires wildly into occupied dark
  space.

### Mounted Combat

Mounted characters receive:

- **+1 to hit** (unless using minor or small weapons) and a **+1 AC bonus** when in mêlée combat against enemies on
  foot.
- **–4 penalty** to hit with missile fire while mounted.
