### Attack

1. Actor can attack if enemy **within striking range** - GM informs of opponent’s AC.
2. Actor rolls **1d20 + modifiers** - Hits if result equal or higher than defender’s AC .
3. **Strength** modifiers apply to **melee**. **Dexterity** modifiers apply to **ranged** attacks.
4. On succesful hit, actor rolls the weapon’s damage.

### Change Weapons and Attack

1. Changing a weapon means droping the current one and drawing another.
2. New weapon must be easily accessible.
3. Attack penalty -2 when that happens.

### Cast Spell

1. Spellcaster may hold **up to a staff or holy symbol** on one hand to cast a spell.
2. Cannot move at all during the round of the spellcasting.
3. If taken damage earlier in the Round spellcaster cannot cast spell that Round.

### Hold Action

- Any action can be held until the end of the Round, and at the time the action is taken, it happens simultaneously, not
  before, other actions are taken.
- For instance, if waiting for an enemy to close later in the Round before attacking, when that enemy closes both
  attacks happen simultaneously.

### Move

- A character can move up to ⅓rd of his normal movement rate in feet every Round, and can also attack during this Round
  if there is an enemy within that distance.

### Charge

- A character can charge, moving his full rate and doing double damage, but suffering a **–2 AC penalty** for that
  Round.
- Characters with weapons that can receive a charge automatically strike first against an enemy closing into mêlée range
  with them, unless they have already acted that Round, and do **double damage** against the charging enemies.

### Parry

- Characters can decide to defend themselves in combat at the expense of all other possible activity.
- No other action is allowed during a Round in which a character parries, although the player is free to decide that his
  character is parrying at any point during the Round, even out of Initiative sequence, provided that the character has
  not yet acted.
- This gives a **+2 AC bonus** for the Round, or a **+4 bonus** for Fighters, Dwarfs, and Elves.

### Use an Item

- If an item is in a character’s hands, or handy on their belt, the character can use it freely.
- If the item is in a pouch, the item will take **1d3+1** rounds to ready (including the first Round).
- If the item is in a sack or backpack it will take **3d3** rounds to ready (including the first Round).
- During this time, the character can be attacked as if from behind.
- Choosing to defend with normal AC the Round does not count as searching for the item.
